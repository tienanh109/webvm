# Online Web Virtual Machine
As a virtual machine running in the browser, the source code based on the original project is from [copy/v86](https://github.com/copy/v86)

In this version I will only upload the built version and remove the available image (this is stupid)
Update: I will not upload due to policy concerns 

Also I plan to add keyboard support for mobile and modify the UI.

[Preview version](https://vm.tienanh109.dev/)

Yeah it's much worse than the original so use [Copy/v86's version](https://copy.sh/v86/)
